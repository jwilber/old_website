	<p class="intro">My name is Jared Wilber and I am a senior studying statistics at UC Berkeley.</p>
	<p>I created this website so that I could post my own content related to data science. Specifically, that consists of  stuff related to statistics, algorithms, visualizations, or anything else I find interesting in the domain. I use primarily R and Python.</p>
	<p> Aside from the aforemention academia stuff, I also enjoy surfing, fitness, skateboarding, reading, traveling, music, and, last but not least, crying alone in cold showers.</p>
	
	<p> Oh, and the walrus pic is unrelated to anything. I just think it looks really cool. </p>
