	<p class="intro">Hey, hey, hey.</p>
	<p>My name is Jared Wilber. I'm a statistics major at UC Berkeley with an emphasis in computer science. I created this website so that I could post my own content related to data science. Specifically, that consists of  stuff related to statistics, algorithms, visualizations, or anything else I find interesting in the domain. I use primarily R and Python. Right now everything is R related, but pretty soon I'll be adding Python and Java implementations. Stay tuned!</p>
	<p> Aside from the aforemention academia stuff, I also enjoy surfing, fitness, skateboarding, reading, traveling, music, and, last but not least, crying alone in cold showers.</p>
	
	<p> The walrus pic is unrelated to anything. I just think it looks really cool. </p>
